Slack can be an incredible tool if you can get the most out of it, yet many don't make the most of Hack Club's awesome Slack platform. It can facilitate easy communication to create stronger leadership teams and organizing abilities.

# Naming Slack Channels

For any given event or club, different Slack channels should be formed to facilitate separate discussions.

# Mason Hack Club

For example, for Mason Hack Club, we have four channels on top of a leadership channel to talk about development, finance, operations, and outreach.

# Hack Cincinnati

Hack Cincinnati is similar. We broke our discussions up into multiple different channels, just like masonleads, but notice that we have two new and unique channels called #hc-data and #hc-important. #hc-data reports data using Zapier in real time, and #hc-important is a channel for the leadership team to announce important things, such as venue changes, big sponsorship agreements, and more!
