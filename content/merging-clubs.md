> currently i'm in the process of trying to merge multiple comp sci clubs at blair to avoid stepping on each others toes, and by sheer luck, Max happened to text me around that time. anyways, Max told me that some of you have had experience with merging clubs.

Dina wrote an [amazing paragraph of advice on merging clubs](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/GAE0FFNFN/p1559701341028500?thread_ts=1559625630.002800&cid=GAE0FFNFN).

> I've had to merge my hack club with a bunch of other tech clubs into STEAM (STEM but with Art) club so that we all meet on one day. The way we did it is that we would split up into our own thing like running workshops or working on club projects and people of different clubs can shop around and go to other clubs if they're free. Now, my club has had to break away from that since people in the STEAM club really wanted to be at the workshop but told me the reason they weren't coming was because they had to work on their individual club things. I think the best way to go about it would be to switch every few meetings between your club and another club (one day you run a workshop, and the next another club does and so on) so you rotate workshops/ activities. This is a lot simplier because then you can tell the students of you school that the hack club workshops are every _x_ weeks _y_ day and that'll help people in the school distinguish between your hack club and the other clubs which keeps things simple IMO.
