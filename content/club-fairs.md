Club fair, club rush, freshman orientation, or whatever your school calls it, they are all the same thing: a time for all the clubs in a school to get together, set up individual booths, and try to advertise their club and get as many students as possible to join them. Here are some of my thoughts on how the 2019 freshman orientation went for Westborough High School’s Hack Club.

_\*Disclaimer: Every school and every club is different, so depending on your school, you will have varying experiences with fa club fair. Also, these are just **my takeaways** on how the whole thing went, I am not saying that other members of my club have the same thoughts.\*_

# Context

My school has about 1200 total students, and approximately 300 upcoming freshmen were at freshman orientation. Over 1 hour, over 30 clubs were vying for the attention of the soon-to-be freshman.

# What Westborough Hack Club Did

So the leaders of my club and I decided that we would go all out. That entailed making a [presentable website](https://whs.hackclub.com), a web app that would change the background color when you texted the name of a color to a number, laying out a ton of stickers for people to take, handing out candy to anyone that walked by, having special candy (jolly ranchers are so very special aren’t they) to students who got a score over 50 on snake, and lastly a laptop for students to fill out an interest form on.

# The Pitch

To ensure that each member of the club was saying the same thing and was adequately advertising the club, we made sure to practice and prepare for several different scenarios that could have occurred. Here are some of them:

**A student just walks up and stand there**

Us: Hey! Are you interested in Hack Club?

_Note: With what we had on the screens, students were more-or-less able to understand what hack club was and what we do, so we didn’t exactly have to explain that we were a computer science club and whatnot_

**Student: Yes**

Us: Great! Do you have any experience?

**Student: Yes**

Us: Fantastic! What do you have experience in?

Student: _responds with something_

Us: Wow, that’s really cool! Just fill out our interest form and we will send you a text before our first meeting. Also, make sure to take stickers and candy.

**Student: No**

Us: That’s totally fine, we welcome people who are complete beginners as well as experts. We have workshops and will guide you through the ropes. Just fill out our interest form and we will send you a text before our first meeting. Also, make sure to take stickers and candy.

**Student: No**

Us: That’s fine. Take some candy and stickers anyway! Also, fill out our interest form just in case so that we can send you a text before our first meeting, we will have some pizza there, so show up if you are free and if you feel like it’s just not for you, you obviously don’t have to show up for future meetings.

# How It Went

We set up our booth right at the entrance and had quite the eye-catching display, so we can be pretty confident in saying that every student that was there saw our booth. As a result of that, however, a lot of students standing around and just messing with different colors that the TV could change to. Which was a really good thing, but many of the students that were up there texting a color to change the background never really spoke to any of the club leaders, which I felt was a real shame. Overall, I would say that the club fair went pretty well and that as a club, we did just about everything that we could possibly do to attract students and try to get them to join the club.

# Our Takeaways

The biggest thing I learned from this was that: **Hack Clubs, and Computer Science Clubs, in general, are not that established in schools at the moment.** I came to this conclusion by comparing the number of sign-ups that our Hack Club got, about 30, to the number of signups other clubs got. For this comparison, I am going to be using our schools' debate club, which got about 50-60 sign-ups and their booth was nowhere near as elaborate as ours. In other words, between two clubs that were established at a similar time, where one club was far more eye-catching in terms of its presentation, the club that wasn’t as eye-catching got more sign-ups. Although I realize that I am leaving some other variables out of this, I took this as even though Hack Club peaked in terms of a presentation, debate club was able to get more sign-ups. Thus, I would, for the most part, say that debate club got more sign-ups due to being a more established club in the eyes of the students in general (keep in mind, the debate club at WHS was founded just one year before WHS Hack Club was founded).

Now, what would I change next year to try to get more students? Other than talking to more of the students who were just standing around, I don’t think that changing anything would have led to a much larger number of people signing up because every student saw our presentation and more-or-less understood what Hack Club was, but we only got about 30 sign-ups, about 10% of the rising freshman. I understood this as the best the WHS Hack Club could do and other than getting more credentials for Hack Club/CS Clubs, I don’t think that many things would enable us to get more than 10% of students to sign-up.
