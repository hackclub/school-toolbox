## Safari

This one is niche, but if you or your club members happen to be on Macs and pay for iCloud storage(iCloud+), using Safari can be a simple solution because of Private Relay, which is a "proxy" built in to Safari.

## GitLab/BitBucket

While some schools have blocked GitHub, it is possible that they have not blocked [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

## Cloud Central Repo

If GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket are all blocked, you can make one repo in a cloud service for your club, give all your memebers a folder, and have them use that for version control.

## Proxy/VPN **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

If your school's disciplinary policies are compatible with this, this is a simple solution. Again, **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**.

## CodeSpaces

If you are unable to install IDEs but want a good web IDE, [GitHub CodeSpaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is a good solution for this, assuming GitHub is not blocked.

## Sourcing Laptops

If your issues stem from device restrictions, you could ask community focused companies in your area and ask them for old laptops. You should probably get approval from your advisor before doing this.

## Mass Advisors

If you are unable to find an adivsor that is STEM focused, finding a person who advises large numbers of clubs even if they are not a STEM teacher could help because them advising a lage number of clubs shows they are up to the task.
Some schools even allow non-teachers to be advisors as long as they get school permission and pass a background check.
