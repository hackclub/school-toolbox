description: An argument for why a school district should allow club members access to GitHub, Replit, and developer tools.

As the Co-Creator of the Dorman Hack Club, I have been thoroughly impressed by the district's commitment to educating students in STEM-related fields. Our Chromebooks, internet connection, course offerings, and facilities have allowed our members to excel in our weekly Hack Club meetings.

You may be unfamiliar with Hack Club, the international network of clubs we are a member of. To learn more about Hack Club, visit the [Hack Club website](https://hackclub.com/) to discover how Hack Club empowers students to discover the joy of coding through building projects.

Dorman Hack Club members are ready to begin collaborating on their projects, and the industry standard to support this sort of collaboration is [GitHub](https://github.com/), a development tool maintained by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/). GitHub allows developers to securely store their code and push updates to collaborative projects.

Currently, GitHub is blocked on school-issued Chromebooks, and we at the Dorman Hack Club request that you reconsider the blocking of GitHub to allow students to collaboratively build their projects and securely store their code.

Additionally, we ask that the district allow students to use Replit, an online coding environment compatible with school-issued Chromebooks. This editor will enable students to develop in nearly every commonly used language from the safety of their web browser.

We also recently noticed that the District blocked the inspect panel within Chrome on school-issued Chromebooks. Allowing the inspect menu would be helpful in allowing students to understand how websites are built and to debug their own websites.

Thank you so much for your support of the Dorman Hack Club, and we hope to hear back from you soon regarding how the district will support Dorman Hack Club's missions to help students discover the joy of coding by creating, shipping (a.k.a launching), and sharing their projects. Finally, I've attached a letter from Leo McElroy at Hack Club HQ

Sincerely,

Thomas Stubblefield, Dorman Hack Club Co-Creator
