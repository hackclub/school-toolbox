title: Letters to IT & Administrators
---

Hack Clubs allow creative students to create technical projects. Tools such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) (maintained by Microsoft), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (maintained by Adobe), and [Replit](https://replit.com/) are widely used in the tech industry and play a vital role in empowering creators. Hack Clubs around the world use these tools for their projects, but sometimes schools or districts may block them. As a Hack Club leader, you can contact your school or district’s IT department to request that they unblock these websites, so your Hack Club can do what they do best: build awesome projects together.

Some Hack Club leaders need to convince administrators who don't understand how a Hack Club is different from any other type of CS club that might already exist at the school. 

Below, we’ve provided examples of letters sent to IT departments in hopes of getting core tools unblocked, and of a letter sent to administrators providing context and differentiating Hack Club from other types of technical clubs. We hope these examples give you inspiration if you're faced with similar challenges at your school. Also try sharing [this page](https://hackclub.com/content/it-admins/) with them!
