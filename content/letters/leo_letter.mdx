To whom it may concern,

[Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit which provides educational resources for learning to code to teenagers around the world. We provided these resources for free thanks to the support of donors such as Tom Preston-Werner (founder of GitHub) and Elon Musk.

For your students to have access to our resources we recommend you whitelist:

- \*.hackclub.com
  - Our main website where we provide code editing environments and workshops.
- github.com
  - The industry standard site for sharing code and information publicly.
- replit.com
  - An online code development environment
  - More information on whitelisting replit can be found [here](https://docs.replit.com/teams-edu/it-administrators-toolkit).

These sites are used in thousands of schools globally by millions of students. Restricting access to them severely limits students’ abilities to learn about technology and how to program.

Sincerely,

Leo McElroy
