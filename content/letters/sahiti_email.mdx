description: Clarification of what makes a Hack Club different from other coding clubs, and how the existence of a Hack Club it benefits students.

The email that we are replying to:

In response to your email on Hack Club, I would like to restate my points that this is an organization that would greatly benefit South Forsyth High School and its student body by giving them monumental opportunities.

You’ve stated that Hack Club already closely resembles current clubs that exist, so I’ve taken the time to talk to the presidents of the four SFHS computer science clubs to better understand their goals and focuses. [Here is the full list that I’ve compiled.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mEpZhJC0IvTIRTAG5ev9c2m7nUe3zrDvtoDEWm7zES0/edit)

Here’s a quick summary:

- **Coding Club** is a learning-based club that “meet[s] online and we either have a slideshow that we got through and then learn coding concepts. And then after we learn how to code on those certain coding concepts, we come together and apply it in a Kahoot or fun activity. And after students are done learning we switch to a different language” (Co-President of Coding Club)
- **CyberPatriot** is a competition and learning-based club that orients itself around cybersecurity and the national CyberPatriot competition. “CyberPatriot members need to know everything there is to know about the operating systems they use, whether it be Windows 10, Windows Server, or Ubuntu Linux. We also do a lot of computer networking and cryptography, so these are very useful skills to pick up. Members become experts of Windows and/or Ubuntu operating systems and learn a lot about computer networking and network security” (Co-President of CyberPatriot)
- “**ACSL** is a club focused on the competitive aspects of Computer Science. ACSL itself has contests that test many different subjects within CS that ACSL members will learn, such as Recursion, boolean algebra, and digital electronics. The challenge problems and competitive programming are also covered within ACSL. Although the coding skills that one uses for it may not generalize to general software development/programming, it can help with algorithmic thinking and it is very similar to LeetCode style problems, which is useful in the real world” (President of ACSL)
- **“GirlsWhoCode** is a club that seeks to inspire high school girls to explore the field of coding and get involved in multiple opportunities to improve their coding skills. Our main goals include engaging girls in fun coding activities so that they have the motivation to do it in their own time and enhance their coding skills to the point where they can get involved in hackathons and achieve awards” (President of GirlsWhoCode)

As you can see, all these clubs have unique main focuses. For example, the coding club is learning-based while ACSL and Cyberpatriot revolve around their unique and skill-tailored national competitions that occur throughout the year.

Now here’s a list of Hack Club’s goals and opportunities:

- Our main goal would be to create a [project-based club](https://workshops.hackclub.com/) that has access to the hundreds of opportunities that the global organization Hack Club provides
- Host and compete in sponsored hackathons with a $500 [Hack Club grant](https://hackclub.com/hackathons/grant/)
- Allow individuals to come together and create with coding, learning from each other and hack clubbers around the world
- Involve members in STEM and Technology internships that can help them stand out

To re-emphasize, we are not merely starting a club at South Forsyth High School, but a chapter that is part of a global organization with a network of [talented students](https://hackclub.com/ship/) all over the world. Members of a Hack Club have opportunities to talk in [AMAs](https://hackclub.com/amas/) that have included virtual conversations with [Elon Musk](https://hackclub.com/relon/), Niki Case, Dylan Field, and something that I am a part of in the near future, Sal Khan. They have extraordinary [hackathons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnK4gzO6S3Q) that involve communities coming together to spend a number of hours with like-minded individuals to create coding projects and grow.

Our school currently does not have a space where we can bridge the gap between coding knowledge and the application of those principles to create programs that can be used in the real world. This can include [creating a game on a physical gaming console](https://sprig.hackclub.com/) that can be shipped out _free of cost_, an educational and [interactive web-app math game](https://github.com/hackclub/sinerider) that can help calculus students, or even [workshops ](https://workshops.hackclub.com/)that can be remixed into newer ideas. These examples are all programs created by teenagers in Hack Clubs.

As a leader for Hack Club, it would be life-changing to extend these opportunities to the SFHS student body. I understand that our school is very STEM club dense; however, we have a school of brilliant individuals but not a single open platform where everyone regardless of expertise, gender, or affiliation can create projects together. Although it is possible to have a Hack Club that isn’t affiliated with the school, this would prohibit students who cannot drive or don’t have any kind of transportation to attend meetings.

The only thing in between where we stand now and officially affiliating the club is the administration’s approval for our club.

We are open to any way this organization can be implemented into SFHS and hope this email has given a better understanding of how our goals differentiate from those of other Computer Science clubs.

I am always ready to talk in person, and I have also copied Hack Club on this email. If you are willing, Holly, Hack Club’s Operations Lead, is open to having a conversation to better help you understand what Hack Club can bring to our school.
