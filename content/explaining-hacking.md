Having led my Hack Club at my school for over 2 years, I can’t even remember how many times I’ve been asked whether Hack Club is actually “hacking” people. Here are some tips to help you deal with these questions, so next time you’re “confronted” by a teacher or an admin about your club, you can breeze through the questions!

# Strategy 0: This is hacking

You need to be clear and firm what the word “hack” means to you and your club. Here’s the most standard version of the explanation:

> When we say "hack", we're referring to the"life hack" type of hacking. Simply put, hacking is creative problem solving – and it often includes code. Hack Club teaches students to code and to use coding skills to solve problems, not to crack into your bank account.

If you have enough time to sit down with your audience, you can also bring up a few projects that our students created at club meetings and hackathons.

# Strategy 1: Scale & legitimacy

Usually, schools may determine that your club is sketchy just from the name. Prove to them that it’s not. Here’s an example:

> Hack Club is no ordinary club—it’s a large network of clubs in hundreds of high schools. We have one of the largest online communities for high school programmers. The existence of Hack Club at your school will bring the resources of the entire network and community to the students of your school. For example… our [project-based workshop curriculum](https://hackclub.com/workshops), our [hackathon network](https://hackathons.hackclub.com)_, and direct support from our HQ staff members.

> Hack Club, registered as the Hack Foundation, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, United States. If your school requests proof of non-profit status, you can download a copy here.

While using this strategy to convince faculty, be sure to know exactly what you are talking about.

# Strategy 2: Demo & Showaround

This one is easy. Invite one of your administrators or teachers who questioned you to one of your club meetings. Run your meeting like normal—run a workshop, have your club members demo around, and after the meeting, ask them politely for their feedback.

_Side tip: your club members will naturally behave better when there’s an administrator in the room._

# Strategy 3: Teacher Sponsor’s Got Your Back

You should really get your teacher sponsor on the same boat as you. Find a time to sit down and chat with them about why you are so passionate about making this club successful, and convince them with your arguments first. Your sponsor teacher should know everything you know about the structure of Hack Club, and they should thoroughly understand the philosophy of the club.

If your teacher sponsor is with you on where you want to go with your club, it should be drastically easier to overcome the friction with your student government, other teachers, or admins.
