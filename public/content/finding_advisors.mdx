# Finding an Advisor

by [Cheru Berhanu](https://cheru.dev)

One of the most difficult parts of starting a Hack Club at my fairly large high school was finding an advisor who was willing to devote the time and effort needed to register with our school district and run 90-minute meetings every week. On this page, I'll try to lay out the steps I took to find one and give some advice I've picked up along the way.

## Looking for People

At most schools, clubs are required to have an adult advisor (usually an employee at the school) to manage the paperwork for the club, help find a space for it, and supervise meetings. This person should have a good relationship with your school's administration; if something goes wrong, they'll be the one to back you up.

To start, it's best to look for people who are interested in programming and teaching it to students. This may include CS teachers, IT admins (this connection can be _really_ handy when trying to access blocked sites for your club meetings), and teachers of tech-related classes. You may also be interested in talking to people in your school's math or science departments, or even any non-STEM teacher who you like. It shouldn't be required for your advisor to have programming experience as long your club is totally student-run.

As a last resort, one option could also be to reach out to individuals outside your school, if your school allows for them to supervise clubs. This is what I ended up doing, but in order to get approved by your school district, you may need to find someone who works at your school to formally submit an application.

## Reaching Out

Your next step after finding someone to contact would be to contact them! This, depending on your luck, can be the most or least time consuming part of this process.

You should probably contact the people you know best and trust most first, as the person you choose will be someone you'll have to rely on to run your club. It's also usually a better idea to ask potential advisors in person rather than by email, especially if you don't already know them.

When pitching your club to them, you should try to be pretty clear about what it would entail and what the time commitment would be for them. Mention what you've done so far to get your club started, and what you need help with. If you pitch it as a Hack Club, make sure you stress that you don't mean hacking as in breaking into computer systems.

If they decline, accept it kindly! Thank them for their consideration and keep moving. If you can ask them if they know anyone else who'd be interested, that could also be helpful. It may take talking to several people before finding one willing to volunteer - I had to ask eight people before finding someone interested! No matter what, it's important to stay persistent.
